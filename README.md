# Project-resume v2.0

## Description
After creating my first resume, I learned a lot.<br> 
This time I decided to use HTML at a minimum and so my web application generates<br>
a resume page through JavaScript. I understand it's not effective, but I was<br>
interested in doing it that way.

## Technologies
JavaScript<br>
SASS<br>
ES Module

## Usage

-Install dependencies
```ruby
npm i
```
-Build production bundles

```ruby
npm run build
```

Will compile, autoprefix sass to css and output assets directory and all other files to ./public.<br>
After building for production you can take the `./public` directory and deploy it.
